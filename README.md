Practicing Socket Programming in Python

## Why Python?
This repository is for understanding the basics of network programming.
To reduce the burden of low-level programming and focusing on the concepts, I choose Python instead of the standard languages such as C/C++.

I also tried Go and Rust, but both languages abstract the flows, whereas Python's `socket` library provides the APIs that are almost in 1-1 correspondence with the ones provided by C/C++.
